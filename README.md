This project was created with the idea of being able to use one widget and have it behave more platform specific.
We are starting with the Buttons and form field inputs.  Eventually we would like to move up to entire scaffolds and forms.
We have done our best to match the padding, fonts, etc from the various branding materials available on the web.
If something is wrong, please msg with the issue and a reference link to the correct info.
### Here are the resources we used to make these decisions.
